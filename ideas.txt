World
=====
* World with different types of resources
* Assume 2d world
* Time is discrete
* For each time step, each pet executes one instruction

Resources
=========
* Each type of resource in the world can be gathered and converted into energy
* Different types of resources are gathered at different rates, and converted at different rates
* Resources regenerate
* Types of resources:
    Type        |   Gather speed    |   Conversion      |   Regeneration    |   Abundance
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * Wood      |   Fast            |   Slow            |   Slow            |   Medium
    * Stone     |   Slow            |   Extra Slow      |   Extra slow      |   Large
    * Sun       |   Medium          |   Medium          |   Instant         |   Infinite
    * Fruit     |   Medium          |   Instant         |   Fast            |   Small

Pets - Basic
============
* Programmable pets
* Each "instruction" in a pet takes a certain amount of energy
* Pets can carry a certain amount of unconverted resources
* Instructions include:
    * Move up/down/left/right
    * Attack
    * Gather resource
    * Sleep
    * Increase defense
    * Increase transport speed
    * Increase attack
    * Increase gather speed
    * Write reproduction storage to nearest pet
    * Trigger offspring
* An instruction that cannot be executed is ignored
* Gathered resources automatically and continuously convert into energy

Reproduction
============
* Pets mate and reproduce
* Each pet has a "reproduction storage" that can be filled with genetic material from other pets it meets
* A pet slowly fills up its own reproduction storage, and if it waits long enough, can produce offspring on its own
* All copying into a reproduction storage involves a risk of scrambling (changing of instructions)
* The more similar two partners are, the larger the risk of scrambling
* Mating consists of exchanging a certain amount of information between pets
* The reproduction storage consists of a list of instructions, and a mapping for each partner petx on the form
    Number of instructions by petx -> {defense of petx, speed of petx, attack of petx}
* Mating could happen between more than 2 pets
* An offspring can be triggered at any point in time
* Triggering offspring starts a gestation, the length of which depends on the length of the reproduction storage
* A newborn starts off with a basic level of defense/attack/transport/gather, derived from but lower than its parents

Attack
======
* Pets can attack other pets
* Being attacked or attacking can lead to damages
* Damages can lower or disable functionality such as transport, reproduction capabilities, resource -> energy conversion, resource gathering, ...
